# Chicago Skyline

## Direction for Update

These directions have been created using Inkscape 1.1 on MacOS.

1. Save the Skyline as skyline.svg with the original skyline as the background.
2. Go to `File -> Save As...` and save it somewhere outside the repo, i.e. `/tmp/skyline.svg`.
3. Delete the `JPEG` layer.
4. Draw a square to clip the boundaries of the image.
5. Align the square over the mask, i.e.:
   1. Duplicating the X and width of the landscape.
   2. Select the mask first and landscape second, then align bottom edges.
6. Group all of the skyline objects under the clipping rectangle.
7. Select the skyline group first and clipping rectangle second.
8. Go to `Object -> Clip -> Set`.
9. `Select All` then go to `File -> Document Properties...`
   1. Resize the page to drawing or selection.
10. Save the image as `/tmp/skyline.svg` again.
11. Change the `preserveAspectRatio` to `xMidYMin meet`.
12. Move the file into its final location.
